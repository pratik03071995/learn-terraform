# Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project

![Terraform Logo](https://www.terraform.io/assets/images/og-image-f5b06f0e.png)

This repository contains Terraform code for provisioning and managing infrastructure on GCP using Terraform. Use this README to understand the project structure and how to use it effectively.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- Credentials and access to the [Cloud Provider Name] platform.
- [Other prerequisites specific to your project.]

## Getting Started

Important --
please manually delete the resource if you want to update the existing resounce in GCP . Pipelie will fail in case resource is already available . The pipeline only create new resource , does not support managing pre-deployed resources . 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/pratik03071995/learn-terraform.git
   cd your-terraform-project
   ```

2. Initialize your Terraform workspace:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Customize the configuration files to match your infrastructure requirements (see [Usage](#usage)).

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Confirm changes by typing "yes" when prompted.

6. Wait for Terraform to provision your resources. This may take some time depending on the complexity of your infrastructure.

7. Once the provisioning is complete, Terraform will display a summary of the changes applied and any output values you defined (see [Outputs](#outputs)).

8. To view the current state of your infrastructure, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   terraform show
   ```

9. To make any further changes to your infrastructure, modify the Terraform configuration files and re-run `terraform apply`.

10. To destroy all resources created by Terraform, run:

    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

11. Confirm the destruction by typing "yes" when prompted.

Remember to review the [Terraform Commands](#terraform-commands) section for more details on available Terraform commands and their usage.

## Usage

[Provide detailed instructions on how to use your Terraform configuration. Include examples, descriptions of resources being created, and any additional setup or configuration required.]

## Variables

google_credentials = "numeric-chassis-412718-18373869df40.json"
google_project     = "numeric-chassis-412718"
google_region      = "us-central1"
bucket_name        = "fnu-pratik-bucket-name"
dataset_id         = "fnu_pratik_dataset"
table_id           = "test_table"
table_id_2         = "check_table"

## Outputs

[List the output values that users might find useful after running `terraform apply`. Include descriptions for each output.]

## Terraform Commands

Here are some common Terraform commands:

- `terraform init`: Initialize a Terraform workspace.
- `terraform plan`: Show changes before applying.
- `terraform apply`: Apply changes to create or update infrastructure.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroy all resources managed by the configuration.
- `terraform fmt`: Format Terraform configuration files.

For more commands and options, refer to the [Terraform CLI documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/index.html).
